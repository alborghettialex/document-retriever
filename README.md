# Fast Document Retriever

## What is it

A simple interface where you can upload multiple documents and perform a semantic search across them. The documents should be text documents. The allowed formats are `.txt`, `.docx` and `.pdf`. More formats and different types of data—such as images, tables, and more—will be supported in the future.
